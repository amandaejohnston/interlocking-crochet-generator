# Interlocking Crochet Generator

https://interlocking-crochet-generator.onrender.com/

An app for drawing custom crochet designs using the interlocking crochet technique. The pattern is automatically generated as you draw. A left-handed setting is even included to ensure your finished product isn't horizontally flipped. Grid size and displayed colors are fully customizable. Diagonal stitches and displaying more than two colors are not supported at this time.

Made with create-react-app.
